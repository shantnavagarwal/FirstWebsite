This platform takes inspiration from skates used by us as a form of locomotion. This platform is more suitable for movement along plain surfaces as compared to bipedal mechanisms due to its simplicity and requirement of only a small amount of computation power for balance. We aim to develop this platform for use on ice as well!</p>\n<p>This project is currently under development at the Mechatronics Lab at IIT Delhi. I along with Prof. J P Khatait and Mr Rajesh Kumar (PhD student) are collaborating on this effort. We have already fabricated our working prototype and started designing the control algorithms for this system. We have also written a paper on our findings which we are in the process of publishing to the ASME journal.

We use the Hertzian contact model to calculate forces between the interacting soft bodies. We used this model to look at the interaction of the colonoscope with the human body.

These machine learning models are susceptible to many types of attacks. These attacks can be categorised along three dimensions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Timing: This dimension assesses when an attack took place. This can either be before the model has been trained (Poisoning attack) or after (Evasive attack). In a poisoning attack, the attacker aims to modify the data being fed into the model; while in an Evasive attack, the adversary changes the datapoint being fed into the model.</li>\n<li>Information: This dimension addresses the amount of information that is made available to the attacker. When an attacker has complete information about the ML model, it is known as a <em>white-box </em> On the other hand, in a <em>black-box</em> attack, the attacker has very limited knowledge. He, however can gain more knowledge about the model through queries, and subsequently training a substitute model.</li>\n<li>Goals: It is also important to look at the goal of the adversary. Generally, an attacker would aim to either target a particular class, or she may aim to reduce the precision of the model as a whole!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I found the book “Adversarial Machine Learning” by Ronald J. Brachman to be a great resource while doing my research!</p>\n<p>I investigated targeted poisoning black-box attacks on models trained on the GTSRB dataset.
